## Card Color Translation

In the world of Dildo Party, there are no classic card colors anymore. The new colors are:
- **Dildo** instead of Spades
- **Butt** instead of Hearts
- **Christmas Tree** instead of Clubs
- **Coffin** instead of Diamonds  

If you announce the wrong color, you will face a tough penalty and have to **draw two cards**!

## Game Setup
Each player receives **seven cards**. An additional card is revealed and placed on the discard pileâ€”the revealed card has no effect. Let the fun begin!

## Game Rules

### Basic Rules
- The game is played according to classic Mau-Mau rulesâ€”with spicy twists!
- If the played card matches the discard pile in number or color, it can be laid down.
- Once you have only one card left, you must shout **"Dildo Party!"** loudlyâ€”otherwise, you'll draw **two additional cards**!

### Card Special Functions

1. **Ace (A)**: When you play an Ace, you may draw a card from a player of your choice.

2. **2**: When you play a 2, you choose the color (Black or Red). A 2 can only be played if it matches the previous card.

3. **3 to 6**: These cards are peaceful and currently have no function. Who knows, maybe a NSFW expansion is coming soon...ðŸ‘€

4. **7**: The next player must draw **two cards**, unless they also have a 7, which they can immediately playâ€”then the next player must draw **four cards**, and so on.

5. **8**: The next player must skip their turn. If they also have an 8 and are quick enough, they can play it and pass the penalty along.

6. **9**: You draw a card from another player and then give them either that card or another card from your hand back.

7. **10**: The next player must draw **seven cards**â€”even if you just laid down your last card and would have "won"! However, if they also have a 10, they can play it and pass the 7-card penalty to the next player. (A player who has 7 or more cards in hand is spared hereâ€”lucky you!)

8. **Jack**: A Jack can always be played, and you choose a new color (remember: it's Dildo, Butt, Christmas Tree, or Coffin!).

9. **Queen**: A Queen can always be played, and you may lay down an additional **Freestyle Card**. This card does not have to match the Queen, so feel free!

10. **King**: The next player must draw **four cards**, unless they also have a King. Then the next player must draw **eight cards**, and so on.

11. **Joker**: A Joker can always be played, but bewareâ€”the player who plays it must challenge another player to a game of **Rock-Paper-Scissors**! If they win, the Joker is safely on the discard pile. If they lose, they must take the Joker back into their hand, and their turn ends.

### The "Dildo Party" Call
If a player forgets to shout "Dildo Party" with their last card, they must draw **two cards**â€”but only if the next player has already drawn!

**The winner is the one who gets rid of all their cardsâ€”unless a sneaky 10 takes them out again!**
